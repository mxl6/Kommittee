<h2><strong>Welcome</strong></h2>

<hr />
<p>Welcome to your public website hosted by OrgSync! The layout, design, and content of the website can be customized and updated from within your portal.</p>

<p>Overview</p>

<p>If you would like to customize this template to match your own site, or do something more creative, feel free. Though, making major template changes will require a basic understanding of HTML &amp; CSS. Otherwise, all content updates and general maintenance can be done via the page editor by someone with little to no code experience.</p>

<p>Locating the Website Builder</p>

<p>To access the &lsquo;Website Builder,&rsquo; select the &lsquo;Website&rsquo; option located along your portal&rsquo;s left-hand toolbar. If you do not see this module, <a href="https://help.orgsync.com/entries/24407561-Possible-reasons-a-module-does-not-appear-on-your-portal-s-left-hand-toolbar">click here</a>&nbsp;to learn how to enable it.</p>

<p>Creating New Pages</p>

<p>To add a new website page, locate this option in the top right of the &lsquo;Pages&rsquo; tab while under the &lsquo;Website Builder.&rsquo; The name you come up with will be the quick-URL used for linking purposes. Note: creating a new page does not automatically add it to the site&rsquo;s navigation bar. To learn how to add a link to the navigation, read this&nbsp;<a href="https://help.orgsync.com/entries/24725917-Adding-a-link-to-a-website-s-navigation-bar">article</a>.</p>

<p>Editing Pages</p>

<p>Pages are maintained under the &lsquo;Pages&rsquo; tab of the &lsquo;Website Builder.&rsquo; You&#39;ve already been&nbsp;provided&nbsp;a set of default pages. This page, the index, has the title of home. The rest should be self-explanatory.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: 'lucida grande', sans-serif; line-height: 1.6em;">To edit a page, click the pencil icon and you will access an editor that allows you to edit content, add OrgSync modules, and access the page&#39;s source code. For more information on adding OrgSync modules into a webpage, read this&nbsp;<a href="https://help.orgsync.com/entries/24767826-Adding-OrgSync-modules-to-a-website-page">article</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Resetting the Website</p>

<p>To reset your website, an existing portal administrator must make a formal request to a member of the OrgSync staff.
